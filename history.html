                          Lookism as a term grew in popularity in the 1970s during the fat acceptance movement, according to Wikipedia, and is said "to refer to 'discrimination based on looks.'" It affects many facets of our modern society, with studies being done from its impact in the teaching environment to its impact on the current generation with plastic surgery. <a href="sources.html#lookismwiki">(5.)</a>

                          <h3>
                            Lookism Today:
                          </h3>
                          One of the ways lookism manifests itself in the modern age is in the job industry. In the turn of the century, we saw one of the first fairly publicized pieces on Jennifer Portnick (other than race based ones, as that has its own term but falls under the lookism umbrella technically), a woman who was fired from her job as a workout instructor at Jazzercise. The reason for her getting fired - “it's her size: 5 feet 8 inches, 240 pounds” (https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91866&page=1). Jennifer was deemed unfit to work in a job despite being fitter than the average American, working out six days a week. Their response was 
                          <br><br>
                          <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“‘Consequently, a Jazzercise applicant must have a higher muscle-fat ratio and look leaner than the public. People must believe Jazzercise will help them improve, not just maintain their level of fitness.’” <a href="sources.html#jazzercise">(4.)</a> </blockquote>
                          <br>Luckily for Jennifer, the city of San Francisco where she was located had created a law banning height and weight discrimination.

                          <br><br>Known in the city as the “fat ordinance,” the law added
                          <br><br>
                          <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“height and weight to the same antidiscrimination codes that provide protections for people based on race, religion, color, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and place of birth.” <a href="sources.html#jazzercise">(4.)</a></blockquote>
                          <br>According to the article, it was “inspired by a fitness company advertisement on a billboard last year ... ‘When the aliens come, they will eat the fat ones first.’” <a href="sources.html#jazzercise">(4.)</a>
                          <br><br>Looking at this legislation through the lens of our theoretical framework, SCOT, we see that it was slightly ahead of it’s time due to the social response it got. The term people in the city used to describe it, “fat ordinance,” comes off as derogatory. The technology, in case the law, was created based on the social context of people being discriminated against based on their body shape, a form of lookism. In turn, it did its part in continuing the Fat Acceptance’s movement of body positivity, allowing for people put in this position to take legal action and protect themselves and their careers.
                          <br><br>On the opposite spectrum, technology has shown to perpetuate the existing social norm, for example when officials in the Chinese Navy stated that
                          <br><br>
                          <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">"anyone joining the service in 2006 must be good-looking, tall and polite." <a href="sources.html#bbcchina">(6.)</a></blockquote>
                          <br>Laws like these, while uncommon for good reason, often perpetuate the inherent bias we have on looks and, even worse, make them official and normalize the behavior. The technology here is defined by the social aspect of how we view attractiveness and how we want others to percieve us.
                          <br><br>Workplace hiring discrimination is still common, and legislation is slow to adapt. In 2018, a woman was fired due to her hair being worn in short dreads after refusing to cut or change her hair. The company used it’s hairstyle policy, where 
                          <br><br>
                          <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“an employee’s ‘hairstyle should reflect a business/professional image’ and that ‘[n]o excessive hairstyles or unusual colors are acceptable’ as banning dreadlocks” <a href="sources.html#ucbjournal">(7.)</a></blockquote>
                          <br>This case was unable to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, missing the opportunity to add hair discrimination to the list of anti-racism and anti-lookism policies. “Good Hair,” is a documentary that explores the hair industry and how black woman adopt to a standard of “beauty” not based around their heritage, and something to look at for more information around hair discrimination and trends <a href="sources.html#goodhair">(8.)</a>. 
                          <br>And yet, hiring based on physical attractiveness is still not illegal, only looked down upon socially. In 2015, Abercrombie and Fitch came under fire for their look policies
                          <br><br>
                          <blockquote class='has-text-weight-light is-size-5'>"which at one point dictated everything from fingernail length (no more than ¼ inch beyond the tip of the finger, preferably unpolished) to hair color ('sunkissed' highlights were okay, but no 'extreme styles'"<a href="sources.html#lookpolicies">(10.)</a></blockquote>
                          <br>
                          Mike Jeffries, CEO of Abercrombie until 2014, once said an interview that
                          <br><br>
                          <blockquote> “Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.”
                            “That’s why we hire good-looking people in our stores,” he elaborated later in the article. “Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don’t market to anyone other than that.”<a href="sources.html#lookpolicies">(10.)</a></blockquote>
                          <br>
                          While having your audience be "cool kids" is not necessarily something that should be illegal, Abercrombie's hiring process quickly came under fire with the Supreme Court deciding it was a "forbidden motive" for discriminating against non-whites and those of different religions due to several firings of individuals wearing hijabs or those with different hair. However, hiring attractive people was something they did not think was illegal, and Abercrombie only made their policies more leniant after recieving social backlash. Abercrombies policies, the technology in question, was affected by social pressure, further relating to the SCOT theory.

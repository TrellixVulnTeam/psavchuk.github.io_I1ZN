                      Beauty bias and lookism are inherent to humans, to an extent. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“Studies on newborns have found that human infants as young as 14 hours from birth prefer to look at attractive faces rather than unattractive faces.” <a href="sources.html#lookismwiki">(5.)</a></blockquote>
                      <br>And while it makes sense, it is the hiring manager’s responsibility to be aware of this and avoid it where they can. 

                      <h3>
                        Targeting the Hirers:
                      </h3>
                      There have been several attempts to solve this problem, for example a chrome extension called “antibias”. This plugin obscures the profile picture of the person when looking at their LinkedIn profile, allowing a way for hirers to hide faces while making their judgement on a candidate’s relevance and proficiency for the job. The article also discusses how LinkedIn could implement this as a feature for their website - a mode where you can toggle the photo off for those looking to be as unbiased as possible. Yet this solution is also only temporary and is only for the few hiring managers that are willing to take the extra step of being unbiased.

                      <br><br>Another proposed solution is the used of artificial intelligence. The article titled “Attractive People Get Unfair Advantages at Work. AI Can Help.” on Harvard Business Review explores this topic, claiming that 
                      <br><br>
                      <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“If programmed correctly, AI could become an objective way to measure what we don’t always see ourselves." <a href="sources.html#hbr">(11.)</a></blockquote>
                      However, actually programming AI “correctly” that is objective is a very tough undertaking, as Artificial Intelligence is a product of our social construction and often inherits the biases of the programmers, a topic called algorithmic bias that is worth exploring in it’s own right.
                      <br>
                      <h3>
                        Solution:
                      </h3>
                      As mentioned earlier, The Social Construction of Technology theory means that we define technology as a society and technology defines our society in turn. Because of this, we see that the core and mostly all-encompassing solution to the issue of lookism would be a form of social change and accountability. Lookism is not a new concept, just a relatively new word - many cultures in the past have denounced it: 
                      <br><br>
                      <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“Judging by appearances was prohibited by monotheistic religions ('no graven images') and criticized in ancient and medieval philosophies.” <a href="sources.html#lookismwiki">(5.)</a></blockquote>
                      <br>While calling for social reform is outside my ability, our society is built around seeing attractive people, and social media has set many unrealistic expectations for individuals. However, social media has also served as a vessel for change, and as people begin to get tired of having to meet society’s standards for beauty, the backlash begins to happen. Without social media, many issues such as the Abercrombie one would not have been put into the spotlight, and Abercrombie could still have had it’s policies in written form and official. Society constructing technology means that we have the power to shift the way we view beauty, and in many ways we already have as body acceptance has become more and more normalized for example. As shown throughout the history section, we have seen how society has been able to affect previous technology and implement new technology, and how this has helped us to get to where we are today. The solution is simple, yet complicated, as it boils down to social advocacy for changing and implementing policy, and for holding people accountable and keeping them aware.

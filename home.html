                            <strong>The Social Construction of Technology (SCOT)</strong> theory posits that we define what technology is as a society, and in turn, technology defines society. People in favor of this viewpoint say that what a technology is for and how it is applied cannot be understood unless you understand how the technology is applied in the social context. The social context is what shapes the technology.

                            You’re probably wondering, what was the point of that initial “simulation”? There are many flaws with it - you are missing information LinkedIn normally provides such as previous occupations and activities, and many other factors like recommendations and friends. There is no right answer to which person was the right fit for the job, in this scenario. (And neither person is unattractive either, it was more a test of who looks like they would be fit for a marketing position)
                            
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="text-align: center;">But hopefully, it got you thinking - What made you choose the person you chose?</h4>

                            Luckily, a study with a much larger scope has already been done - 
                            <br>
                            <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">
                                "Researchers sent 11,000 CVs to various job openings, including identical CVs accompanied by candidate photographs of different levels of attractiveness. Attractive women and men were much more likely to get a call back for an interview than unattractive (or no-photograph) candidates were." <a href="sources.html#hbr">(11.)</a>

                            <br>
                        <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">“Physically attractive individuals are more likely to be interviewed for jobs and hired, they are more likely to advance rapidly in their careers through frequent promotions, and they earn higher wages than unattractive individuals.” <a href="sources.html#hbr">(11.)</a></blockquote>
                            <p>According to a study conducted by TheLadders, a career finding website, recruiters spend 
                                <blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">"19 percent of the total time they spend on your profile looking at your picture." <a href="sources.html#heatinsider">(1.)</a></blockquote> 
                            <br> There are good reasons, as your picture says a lot about you and the recruiter has the right to ask questions. Some of them fair - does the person look professional in their picture, are they dressed appropriately, are they presentable? </p>
                            <br> When asked whether people should include a photo of themselves on their LinkedIn profile, Mark Jaffe of CBS had this to say:
                            <br>
                            <br><blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">"'Can we see your face clearly? Is it strictly business? Was the photo professionally done? Does it improve on your qualifications? Finally ... are you attractive enough to be judged on looks alone? Because that's what you're inviting people to do.'" <a href="sources.html#heatinsider">(1.)</a>
                            </blockquote>
                            While the consensus for people in the hiring industry isn't all there, the stigma for profile pictures is. Mariam Salpeter, a social strategist and hiring adviser says that: <br>
                            <br><blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">
                                "There was a time when U.S. job seekers would not consider a photo part of their job-search materials. But since LinkedIn joined the professional scene, things have changed.
                                ... there’s no doubt most people who notice a photo-less LinkedIn profile will assume one of two things: 1) you don’t know how to upload a picture or 2) you are really ugly." <a href="sources.html#pictureinsider">(2.)</a>
                            </blockquote>
                            In the modern age, the process of hiring has embraced social media usage. Privacy is mostly a thing of the past, and those that do not have a social media presence are often questioned about it. 
                            And the bias gets in the way, with more attractive candidates often seen as being more competant according to a study done at University College:
                            <br>
                            <br><blockquote class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5">
                                "An analysis of the results found that while there was no competency difference perceived between the attractive and unattractive female candidates, the attractive male candidate was seen as much more competent than the unattractive male candidate." <a href="sources.html#knowledgebias">(3.)</a>

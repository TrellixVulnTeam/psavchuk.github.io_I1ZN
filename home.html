                            You’re probably wondering, what was the point of that initial “simulation”? There are many flaws with it - you are missing information LinkedIn normally provides such as previous occupations and activities, and many other factors like recommendations and friends. There is no right answer to which person was the right fit for the job, in this scenario.
